# Privacy Policy for Ticket360 Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** July 30, 2025

Thank you for using Ticket360 ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information when you use our Chrome extension (the "Service"). Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information in the following ways:

### a) Information You Provide Voluntarily

- **User Feedback:** When you voluntarily submit feedback, bug reports, or feature requests, we collect the information you provide in your submission.

### b) Information Collected Automatically

- **Jira:** The extension interacts with Jira on your behalf.
  - **Jira:** To provide its core functionality, the extension reads data from your Jira tickets (such as status, assignee history, and comments) via API calls made directly from your browser to your Jira instance (`*.atlassian.net` or `*.jira.com`). This data is processed in real-time and is not stored on our servers.
- **Anonymous Technical Data:** To diagnose issues and improve the extension, we automatically collect anonymous, non-personally identifiable technical information, including:
  - Browser User-Agent
  - Timezone
  - Language settings
  - Screen Resolution

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used exclusively for the following purposes:

- **To Operate and Maintain the Service:** To provide the core features of the extension, such as displaying the 360-degree view of Jira tickets.
- **To Improve the Service:** To understand usage patterns, diagnose technical problems, fix bugs, and develop new features.
- **To Respond to You:** To address your feedback, questions, and support requests.

We **do not** sell, trade, or rent your data to third parties. We do not use your data for advertising purposes.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage:** The extension uses the browser's local `chrome.storage` API to store your settings, such as API keys for Jira and OpenAI. This data is stored on your local machine and is not transmitted to our servers. You are responsible for the security of your own API credentials.
- **Data Transmission:** All communication with Jira and OpenAI APIs is performed over secure HTTPS connections.

## 4. User Consent

By installing and using the Ticket360 extension, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
