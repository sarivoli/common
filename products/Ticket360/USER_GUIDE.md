## 🏁 Getting Started

### 1. How do I connect Ticket360 to my Jira instance?
To get started, you'll need three key pieces of information:
1.  **Jira URL**: e.g., `https://your-company.atlassian.net`
2.  **Email**: The email address associated with your Jira account.
3.  **API Token**: Generate this from your Atlassian account settings.

**Steps:**
1.  Right-click the **Ticket360 icon** in your browser toolbar and select **Options**.
2.  In the **Connection** tab, enter your Site URL, Email, and API Token.
3.  Click **Save & Test Connection**. A green checkmark means you're ready to fly!

### 2. Can I open Ticket360 in a new tab instead of a popup window?
Absolutely. If you prefer a wide-screen experience for complex JQL analysis, you can switch modes.

**Steps:**
1.  Open **Options** (Right-click icon -> Options).
2.  Navigate to the **General** tab.
3.  Check the box that says **"Open as Tab instead of Popup"**.

## 📊 Ticket Analytics

### 3. How can I see the status history of a ticket?
Tired of wondering why a ticket took 10 days to move? Ticket360 breaks down the timeline for you.

**Steps:**
1.  Search for a ticket (e.g., `PROJ-123`).
2.  Click on the **Status History** tab.
3.  **Insight**: You'll see a chronological log of every status change, who moved it, and exactly how many days/hours it spent in that state.

### 4. How can I see the history of a specific custom field (e.g., Story Points or Priority)?
Most tools only show status changes. Ticket360 shows you *everything*.

**Steps:**
1.  Open any ticket in the **Overview** tab.
2.  Locate the field you're interested in (e.g., "Priority").
3.  **Click directly on the field row**.
4.  A detailed timeline will appear, showing every time that specific field was modified and by whom.

---

## 🔍 Advanced Search & Intelligence

### 5. How can I get the results for a specific JQL in a clean table format?
Skip the cluttered Jira UI and get straight to the data using our Advanced JQL search.

**Steps:**
1.  Open the Ticket360 popup/tab.
2.  Click the **JQL Search** tab at the top.
3.  Enter your query (e.g., `project = PE AND status = "To Do" AND assignee is empty`).
4.  Click **Search**. You'll get a lightning-fast table that you can scroll and "Load More" as needed.

### 6. How can I create a Pivot Table for "Assigned User" vs. "Status"?
Turning raw Jira data into actionable insights is what Ticket360 does best. Use the JQL Pivot analysis to spot bottlenecks instantly.

**Steps:**
1.  Run a **JQL Search** (as described in Q5).
2.  Once results appear, click the **Pivot Analysis** button.
3.  In the **Pivot Designer**:
    *   Drag **Assignee** into the **Rows** zone.
    *   Drag **Status** into the **Columns** zone.
    *   Drag **Issue Key** into the **Values** zone.
4.  **Result**: You now have a high-level matrix of who is doing what and where the work is piling up.

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting & Security

### 9. Where are my Jira tokens stored? Is it safe?
Your security is our top priority.
*   **100% Local**: All your credentials and Jira data are stored **only** in your browser's local storage.
*   **Encrypted**: We use browser-level encryption to ensure no other extension or website can access your tokens.
*   **No Clouds**: Ticket360 never transmits your data to any external server. It’s a direct conversation between your browser and Jira.

### 10. I'm unable to connect to Jira. What should I check?
If you're seeing connection errors, follow this checklist:
1.  **URL Format**: Ensure it starts with `https://` and doesn't end with a `/` (e.g., `https://domain.atlassian.net`).
2.  **Token Validity**: Did your API token expire? Try generating a new one in Atlassian.
3.  **Email Match**: Ensure the email in Ticket360 exactly matches your Atlassian account email.
4.  **VPN/Firewall**: If you're on a corporate network, ensure Jira isn't being blocked by a local firewall.

## 🌟 Real-Life Pro Use Cases

### The "Standup Hero" Flow
**Scenario**: It's 2 minutes before your morning standup and you need to know exactly what moved yesterday.
*   **Step**: Open Ticket360, go to **JQL Search**, run `project = YOUR_PROJ AND updated >= -24h`, and copy the results as HTML. Paste it into your team chat. You're done!

### The "Bottleneck Buster" Flow
**Scenario**: A project is lagging, and you need to find out why.
*   **Step**: Open a problematic ticket, click on **Status** field, and look for the duration cells. High numbers in "Code Review" mean your reviewers are the bottleneck.
Note: Make sure you have added **status** column in your Jira field settings.

### The "Accountability" Flow
**Scenario**: A ticket has been bounced around between multiple people.
*   **Step**: Click on the **Assignee** field. See who had the ticket, for how long, and when they passed it on. Perfect for post-mortems and process improvement.
Note: Make sure you have added **assignee** column in your Jira field settings.

## 🎯 Interactive Pivot Tables

### 11. How can I drill down into specific pivot table cells to see the actual tickets?
The pivot table isn't just numbers—every cell is clickable! This lets you instantly investigate what's behind any count.

**Steps:**
1. Run a **JQL Search** and switch to the **Pivot** tab.
2. **Hover** over any cell with a number—you'll see a 🔍 icon appear.
3. **Click** the cell, and a modal window opens showing all tickets that match that exact combination.
4. The modal shows: Ticket keys (clickable to Jira), summaries, and all your configured fields.
5. Click **"Copy as HTML"** to export just those specific tickets for reporting.

**Real-World Example:**
You see "5 issues" at Status: "In Progress" & Assignee: "John Doe". Click it, and you get the exact 5 tickets that are in progress and assigned to John—perfect for quick investigation!

### 12. Can I see all issues for a specific row or column in the pivot table?
Absolutely! Row and column totals are also clickable, giving you aggregated views.

**Steps:**
1. In the **Pivot** tab, look at the **row totals** (right side) or **column totals** (bottom row).
2. **Hover** over any total—you'll see the 🔍 icon and a tooltip.
3. **Click the row total** to see all issues for that row value across all columns.
4. **Click the column total** to see all issues for that column value across all rows.

**Real-World Example:**
- **Row Total Click**: Click the total for Status: "Open" (e.g., 25 issues) → See all open issues regardless of assignee
- **Column Total Click**: Click the total for Assignee: "Sarah" (e.g., 18 issues) → See Sarah's complete workload across all statuses

### 13. Is there a way to export the entire pivot dataset quickly?
Yes! The grand total is your quick access to everything.

**Steps:**
1. Look at the **grand total** (bottom-right cell of the pivot table).
2. **Click it** to open a modal showing ALL issues in your pivot analysis.
3. Review the complete dataset or click **"Copy as HTML"** to export everything.

**Real-World Example:**
You've configured a complex pivot analysis and want to share all the underlying data with your team. Click the grand total (e.g., 150 issues), copy as HTML, and paste into your email—done in 5 seconds!

### 14. How do I know which cells in the pivot table are clickable?
Every non-zero number in the pivot table is clickable, and we've added visual indicators to make this obvious.

**Visual Cues:**
- 🔍 **Icon**: A small magnifying glass icon appears when you hover over clickable cells
- 💬 **Tooltip**: Shows "Click to view X issues" with context
- 🎨 **Color Change**: Cells turn purple (value cells) or dark purple (totals) on hover
- 📏 **Scale Effect**: Clickable cells slightly grow when hovered

**What's Clickable:**
- ✅ **Value cells** (5, 10, 3, etc.) → Shows specific row+column issues
- ✅ **Row totals** (right column) → Shows all issues in that row
- ✅ **Column totals** (bottom row) → Shows all issues in that column
- ✅ **Grand total** (bottom-right) → Shows ALL issues

### 15. Can I use custom field aliases in pivot tables instead of seeing "customfield_12345"?
Yes! Ticket360 automatically resolves custom field names to their friendly aliases.

**How it Works:**
1. In **Settings → Pivot Configuration**, select your custom fields.
2. If the field has an alias/description configured in Jira, it will display that name.
3. In the pivot table, you'll see "Sprint" instead of "customfield_10020".

**Fallback:**
If no alias is configured, Ticket360 formats it as "Custom Field 10020" for better readability.

### 16. What happens when I click a pivot cell with zero issues or an empty cell?
Empty cells and zero-value cells are **not clickable** to avoid confusion.

**Visual Feedback:**
- Empty cells show "-" and are greyed out
- Zero-value cells have reduced opacity
- No icon appears on hover
- Tooltip shows "No issues"
- No color change or scale effect

This helps you focus on cells that actually have data to explore!
